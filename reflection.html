      <h4>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h4>
      <p>The concept of responsive design was originally proposed by Ethan Marcotte in 2010. Responsive design is a set of methods that allow web pages to modify their layout and look in response to various screen width parameters, etc.</p>
      <h4>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h4>
      <p>Pages were designed with a specified screen size in mind in the early days of web design. When a user uses a smaller or larger screen than the designer intended, the results can range from unnecessary scroll bars to too long lines or wasted space. So, the concept of responsive design has been created as consumers use a larger range of screen sizes.</p>
      <p>Responsive design is not just about screen resolution adaption and auto-scaling images, etc. It is more like a new way of thinking about design - responsive is a two-sided, interactive process in which the designer considers the performance of the device, the number of Dom nodes, the size of the screen, etc.</p>
      <h4>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h4>
      <p>When we talk about responsive design, we have to discuss Mobile-First Responsive Design, which argues that prioritizing mobile devices with greater screen constraints and then expanding to larger PC screens is a more successful design method. Because the mobile side's style is relatively simple, the transition to the PC side's style is smoother.</p>
      <p>In the actual design process, usually designers design the elements in a web page in modules, adjusting different layouts for different screens. The front-end engineer then takes the different layouts designed by the designer, writes CSS files, and adapts them to different resolutions. At the same time, he has to use Media Queries to pull resources of different sizes according to different resolutions to speed up the loading of the page and reduce traffic consumption.</p>
      <h4>Describe your learning experience in the course.</h4>
      <p>I had never been exposed to web design before taking this course, so I felt overwhelmed at the beginning of the class. However, after this semester, I have learned 3 technologies of front-end development, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. They look like three different technologies, but in practice, they are used in conjunction with each other.</p>
      <p>HTML is used to markup content, which is a simple markup language. It uses various tags to organize the elements of a page and tell the browser how to display the content.</p>
      <p>CSS is used to modify the content style, which is used to express the style of HTML files and is simply responsible for the presentation and layout of elements in HTML pages.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is used to do interaction. JavaScript is a scripting language that runs on the client-side as well as on the server-side, and its interpreter is the JS engine, which is part of the browser. JavaScript is mainly used to extend the interactive capabilities of a document so that static HTML has certain interactive behaviors (such as form submission, animation effects, pop-ups, etc.).</p>
      <p>Personally, my JavaScript skills are weaker than HTML and CSS, so whenever I encounter a design that requires JavaScript for interaction, it takes me a long time. For example, for this final assessment, I spent about 80% of my time on the info module. In the future, I will continue to practice JavaScript and hope to make progress in future studies. </p>
